# Moodial

A cross-platform mobile application facilitating the positive psychology practice of mood tracking.

## Abstract

Mood tracking is a technique in positive psychology that includes the tracking, recording, and analysis of a person’s mood. Psychotherapists usually recommend it to patients who want to improve their mental health. It can be used personally or to support a counselling programme with a professional psychotherapist. This project addresses the facilitation of this process, for both previously mentioned contexts, in a manner that would allow a user to easily begin practicing this technique by means of the design and development of a cross-platform mobile application. Positive mood can enhance cardiovascular, hormonal and immune functions, promote healthy behaviours such as better sleep and exercise, and lead to more open-minded thinking and effective problem solving. The aim of this project is to build an application that and improves upon existing apps that assist users with this practice and allows users to maximize the benefits of taking a proactive approach to self-management of mood.

## Technology

This project involves the development of the front-end and the design of an appropriate user interface for the given context. The app will communicate with a database via an API that has been created in a past student’s final year project. Flutter, developed by Google and built on the Dart language, was chosen as a framework for cross-platform mobile application development. Flutter is unique and extremely powerful in that one codebase is all that is needed to build for both iOS and Android. The API from the past project was developed as a Python web application using Flask as a framework.
